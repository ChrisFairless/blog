  London needs to know its future population to plan for school places, housing and infrastructure. I've been building the next generation of population models to do this.
  *  Creating a modular demographic model that enables customisation and experimentation.
  *  Introducing stochastic uncertainty to the model based on timeseries analysis of migration data.
  *  Exploring how machine learning and new data sources can improve the modelling of birth and death rates
  *  Implementing version control, Agile methodolgies, coding best practices and code review for the team. Making sure our published results are fully reproducible from the raw data.
  *  Liaising with stakeholders and academics to better guide model design
  *  Work in R, bash, SQLite, SPARQL

  I worked on the Event Response team, writing and maintaining code that to forecast and reconstruct natural disasters in near-real time. I specialised in European extratropical cyclones and western Pacific tropical storms, but also worked to model floods, wildfires, earthquakes, severe convective storms and hurricanes.
  *  Forecasting and reconstructing natural disasters using observational data, weather agency forecasts and the RMS models.
  *  Improving, extending and automating code. Adapting existing processes to work with new models and regions.
  *  Designing and building new products.
  *  Writing daily briefings and reports for clients.
  *  Work in R, bash, PostgreSQL, with some perl, python and Fortran.

  I worked with the European Flood team, adapting the in-house flood model to include the effects of climate change. My work took an event set of 50,000 years of stochastic rainfall data and came up with a novel reweighting method to be consistent with different IPCC climate change scenarios. The work is now being published.

  My research quantifed the range of structures found in intense small-scale Arctic storms - polar lows. I used a cyclone tracking routine to identify polar lows in historical reanalysis data, and automated the analysis of their structures, adapting a technique used to study the transition of hurricanes into midlatitude storms. This let me identify storm structures associated with the most hazardous weather. Funded by the Natural Environment Research Council.

   *  An extended, self-directed project.
   *  Analysing very large datasets with NCL, with some work in C and Fortran.
   *  Running case study simulations and sensitivity tests with the WRF and Polar WRF models, which I compiled, optimised and ran on the UK's ARCHER HPC supercomputer.
   *  Presenting work internationally and publishing results.
